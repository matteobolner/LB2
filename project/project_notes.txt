Introduction:
	-problem and solution
	-history of the methods of prediction (1st, 2nd, 3rd generation, papers)
	-revise the recent literature on 2ndary structure prediction 
		-also combined methods (solvent accessibility, contact maps etc)
	-applications of 1ndary structure prediction --> ex. finding remote homologs, refine ab initio methods for prediction of 3tiary structure

	-what i am going to do, what i did and antiicpate the main results obtained
	

Matherials and methods
	-datased used to train (derived from previous work, defined from specific paper with specific method 
	-procedure to generate sequence profiles (preprocessing of data) with database, program, all other relevant procedures --> also the fact that for some sequences you cant get the profile, and how you handletd it
	-blind set
		-filters applied on pdb, to reduce redundancy ,
		-how you generated 2ndary struc (dssp, descrive method)
-describe in details GOR method (dont describe your implementation, describe mathematically(information content)
			-in other section you can talk about the implementation methods
			-describe scoring indexes and why SOV is important, why second level(???) indexes are not significant



Results and discussion :
	2 sections
	-cross validation
	-

Conclusion
	-try to be "creative"
	-repeat what you did , expand a bit more on the result discussion putting some idea that you already discussed in the result section

References
	-follow the bioinformatics style (name,year) for CITATIONS
	-et al for authors instead of all the names



UNDER 7 PAGES


also put all the scripts used on a repository and give him the link

	Supplementary materials:
		-separate data and text/graphs
			-stuff that you can print separated from stuff like the whole list of the blind set

	dont put them in the supplementary materials
	also dont give the complete list of proteins


use a reasonable scale for residue arrangment (see casadio et al)

pie chart for taxonomic distribution
	-
	-relative fraction of eukariot prokariot and ?? (no need for species, just domain level )
	-heat map
	-

in cross validation report results obtained with the best svm model obtained
	-rest in the supplementary materials
