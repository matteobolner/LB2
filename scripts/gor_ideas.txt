-for each profile, also read dssp file
-for each line in the profile (residue) get the ss
-build a 17x20 matrix for each ss type (so 3 matrices) and a 3x1 matrix which counts all the occurrence of the ss residues
-each residue in the sequence of the dssp is associated to a ss; the ss is what i need
	-each ss in the sequence will be considered as central residue when iterating over the sequence
-for the ss, calculate the 




!!!!! DONT DIVIDE BY NUMBER OF RESIDUES BUT BY THE "COUNTING" OF FREQUENCES --> da capire





PREDICTION:::
you have the three trained windows (trained on 4/5ths of the dataset) and use the other 1/5th as testing set (input the profile of each sequence)
p(SS|WINDOW) = sum of each element of (model_window * I(S|R) from input_profile_window)
