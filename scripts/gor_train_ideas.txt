-for each profile, also read dssp file
-for each line in the profile (residue) get the ss
-build a 17x20 matrix for each ss type (so 3 matrices) and a 3x1 matrix which counts all the occurrence of the ss residues
-each residue in the sequence of the dssp is associated to a ss; the ss is what i need
	-each ss in the sequence will be considered as central residue when iterating over the sequence
-for the ss, calculate the 




!!!!! DONT DIVIDE BY NUMBER OF RESIDUES BUT BY THE "COUNTING" OF FREQUENCES --> da capire
